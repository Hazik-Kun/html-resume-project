    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I possess 4+ years of Talent Acquisition experience in SEA countries. I've been exposed to multiple types of IT roles during my time as recruiter and it has piqued my interest to better assess how a programmer think, perform and what better way to do so other than learning to code, am I right?</p>
